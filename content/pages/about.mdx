You've made your way to the page about me. Nice. I feel weird writing this. Seems sorta conceited to write about yourself. Bleh, oh well.

I am Emma. Originally from Columbus, OH and currently living in Bloomington, IN with my partner and dog. I had two pit-stops before this; one at the University of 
Rochester to get my Bachelor's in Computer Science, and the other in Washington D.C. for a few years after undergrad.

During the day, I'm a software engineer at Arboretum Lifesciences. By after the hours of 9-5 I'm either brainrotting or working on one of my 7,000 hobbies. Tis' but the existence of the neurodivergent.

I don't know my right for my left. Well, in concept I do but in practice it's a different story. I have considered getting _R_ and _L_ tattooed on the appropriate wrist to help me out with this because when
I hold up hand in an L, they both look correct.

I love the Columbus Crew, and am a first (second) time season ticket owner for the upcoming 2026 season. One my favorite moments ever was going to the MLS Cup final with my mom and watching the Crew triumph 2-1
over LAFC.

In general, I am just odd and introverted. I hate small talk, and prefer to talk about things that matter. At social gatherings, I tend to befriend the dog.

Anyways, that's a pretty good overview of who I am as a human.
