This site began all the way back in 2022 as a NextJS site, hosted on Vercel. Since then, it's migrated to [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) and been hosted on DigitalOcean though I have been considering moving to S3 + Cloudfront now that I am off Next and becoming more comfortable with AWS.

## Stack
