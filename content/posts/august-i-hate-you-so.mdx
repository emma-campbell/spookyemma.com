Last **August (2024)** my mom had a myasthenia crisis. She landed in the hospital for ten days total, on a ventilator for the first four. My family and I were all collectively terrified. Today, she is doing well but it was the scare of a lifetime.

We take a yearly trip to Rhode Island to visit my grandparents who are 80 and 83 respectively. Both have chronic health issues, which tends to come with aging. This year, my grandpa called me a week and some change prior to when I was scheduled to arrive. He had been having stomach pains, fatigue, and a general sense of feeling ill that had been accumulating over the last week. He was worried about getting that house ready for our visit.

So my mom and I hopped in the car, and drove up. We got the house put together, we took him to urgent care, and we got all the ducks in a row. As family does.

Fast forward a week later. He has a scheduled CT and it comes back showing lesions on his hip, liver, and lower lung. Ominous, given his history of prostate cancer.

So don't mind me as I just want to yell into the void: *August, you f'ing suck.*
