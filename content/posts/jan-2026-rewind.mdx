Something I find it really depressing is that I went pretty much all of 2025 without writing much. I spent a lot of time focusing on my reading goals (which I hit for the first time in years), but the lack of writing and creative outlet has hit me relatively hard within the past month.

So, I'll try to start this up again if I can. Maybe actually use my colored pencil set as well.
