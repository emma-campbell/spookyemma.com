I've finally hit my reading goal for the first time *in years*. While 30 books may not feel like a lot to the avid reader, it is somewhat of an accomplishment for me. Throughout the course of the year I've spent a lot of time in tracking apps, trying to make sure I was accurately capturing my time spent reading. None of the existing apps truly felt like they suited my needs.

Goodreads was too, well, Amazon. Fable just… not my thing. Storybook was too graph/stats heavy with too much friction towards the main goal (tracking books) and Margins too AI focused. Most all that I tried left something to be desired user experience and performance wise.

## Introducing Logbook

I've never really had a true side project besides this blog, which upon further reflection is very anti-cool-dev of me. But I guess I truly hadn't had the itch to scratch until now.

Logbook came out of a desire for a better tracking app, aiming to combine the social experiences around books that we all love in a package that feels warm, cozy, and approachable. I plan on tracking our progress and decision making here on my blog.&#x20;

As always, my goal this year is to spend more time writing, whether that be technical or just in general, and this build it out loud fits right within that goal.
