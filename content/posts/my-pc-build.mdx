So, I finally built my first PC. And like any reasonable ADHD person starting a hobby, I went way overboard. My intention was to use this machine mainly for gaming. In terms of components I installed:

- **Case** - [Fractal North](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/north/north/chalk-white-tg-clear/ "Fractal Design North — Chalk White")
- **CPU** - [Ryzen 7800X3D](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d.html "AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D Processor")
-  **GPU** - [Gigabyte Aero Geforce 5080 OC](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N5080AERO-OC-16GD "Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5080 AERO OC 16G")
- **Motherboard** - [MAG X670e Tomahawk Wifi](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MAG-X670E-TOMAHAWK-WIFI "MSI MAG X670E TOMAHAWK WIFI Motherboard")
- **AIO** - [BeQuiet! Pure Loop 3](https://www.bequiet.com/en/watercooler/6706 "be quiet! Pure Loop 3 AIO Cooler")
- **RAM** - [64gb Crucial Pro DDR5 6000MHz](https://www.crucial.com/memory/ddr5/cp2k32g60c40u5w?srsltid=AfmBOooDJ6NHX_yYHb-b8aFXlICT9Iy1JAV6vG0CAeM3DXvQ68RkQR-_ "Crucial Pro 64GB DDR5-6000 Memory Kit")
- **PSU** - [BeQuiet! Dark Power 13 1200W](https://www.bequiet.com/en/powersupply/dark-power-13/4040 "be quiet! Dark Power 13 1200W PSU")

It turned out very nicely, and has run basically every game that I've thrown at it pretty nicely. I consider myself  somewhat of a Windows hater, so I actually ended up throwing [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/ "Omarchy — Linux Desktop Environment") on it, which has worked like a charm. I still use my Macbook for most of my day-to-day work but I have been enjoying my chats with `claude`, learning hyprland, etc.
