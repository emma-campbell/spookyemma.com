Don’t waste four hours like I did 😭. If you're using a private package off of an NPM paid account, you need to specify the registry value in your `.npmrc`. The generated one won't work.

```bash
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

The more ya know.
