After a _rollercoster_ of a year, I am excited to spend some time really appreciating and improving my health. My partner and I have built a home gym in our basement, complete with a squat rack, bumper plates, and a spin cycle. This is the year of really sticking to my fitness goals (I do turn 28...gross) and I intend on sticking with it.
