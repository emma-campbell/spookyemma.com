I'm currently smack-dab in the middle of a cross-state move from Virginia to Indiana. At the time of writing this, I am *10 days away* from key turn-in. My routine, respectively, is f*cked.

I am definitely running behind on replying to emails and doing things that aren't related to moving. So if you reach out to me through *any of the platforms*, you're gonna have to wait a 'lil longer than usual.
