            I&apos;ve picked up some part time work as a Project Manager to
            bring in some extra ðŸ’°. It&apos;s a different kind of challenge, and

            I&apos;m currently smack-dab in the middle of a cross-state move
            from Virginia to Indiana. At the time of writing this, I am{" "}

            f*cked.

          <p>
            I am definitely running behind on replying to emails and doing
            things that aren&apos;t related to moving. So if you reach out to me
            through <i>any of the platforms</i>, you&apos;re gonna have to wait
            a &apos;lil longer than usual.
